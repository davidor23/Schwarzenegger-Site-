            <p>
                Arnold is to this day one of my favourite action stars. He may not be the most polished actor in Hollywood but the screen presence and menacing character he brings to roles such as Terminator, Commando and Predator are what make the last of a dying breed. He got his lucky break after landing the role of Hercules in 1969. His accent at the time was so thick that he had to get subtitles for all of his speaking lines! Early on he was told by many his body type, accent and name were too weird for him to ever be cast in a large Hollywood blockbuster like Arnold had always dreamed of. Arnold got his big break when he got the role of Conan The Barbarian in 1982 which was a huge box office success. In 1984 he landed the role of Terminator where he is most famously known for. This role would go on to define his career to this day remains a classic. The main reason I admire and am inspired by Arnold in this field is because he was laughed at, mocked and given little chance to succeed by anyone in the industry. Arnold chose to keep on falling his dream and eventually made the breakthrough which for me personally is huge inspiration.
