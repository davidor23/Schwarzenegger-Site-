            <h1 class="page title">So Why Arnold?</h1>
            <p>
                So, what made me choose Arnold Schwarzenegger as my inspirational figure? Well, he’s figured out ways to pick a goal or dream and follow through with relentless enthusiasm and spirit. He never seems to allow anyone to break his determination to achieve a goal. This in itself is hugely inspirational. He’s conquered film, bodybuilding and even politics. Any obstacle he had to overcome, such as moving to America without much English or attempting to break into the Hollywood blockbuster scene where he was told he was too weird due to his build and accent. He defied the odds and became a success anyway. I try to implement that indomitable spirit into my work and life and feel trying to achieve a goal without allowing anyone to sway you is a huge reason I find him such a compelling figure. I hope you’ve enjoyed my website dedicated to Arnold Schwarzenegger and maybe you too have learned or taken some inspiration away from this.
