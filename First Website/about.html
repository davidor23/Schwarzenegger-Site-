                Hello I'm David, Studying in Griffith College part-time and working full-time. I enjoy spending my free time socializing with friends or playing video games to relax. I own three turtles back home in Maynooth where I am originally from, They're <em>creatively</em> named Turtle 1,2,3. My biggest pet peeve is when I'm stuck behind someone walking slowly, I have no time for it! I hope you enjoy my third attempt at making a website as much as I am in making it. A famous quote I like is; <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/heraclitus_165537"> - There is nothing permanent except change - <strong>Heraclitus</strong></blockquote>
